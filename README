Celeste PICO-8 "port" to NES
Original game: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145

To build on a *nix system: ./build.sh
You'll need the following programs in your PATH: bash, python3, tiled, nesasm

On Windows you can call NESASM on lightblue.asm, but you won't be able to
rebuild levels' binaries (unless you use msys2 and build it the *nix way)

It's unfinished, but its core mechanics seem to work. It hasn't been tested on
real hardware because I don't own an SD cartridge.

Here's an TODO list:
- Protagonist's TressFX and move animations (does she slide with her face?)
- Death animation
- Speedrun timer
- Title screen
- Maps 3 to 30
- Springs
- Strawberries grab
- Breakable blocks (the ones that break when you stand on them)
- Chests and keys
- Spikes that are not in the bottom
- Jewels / Baloons
- Fix scrolling when re/loading world
- Snowflakes
- Wind? in the background. I think this one is possible on the NES, but it
  would be a headache to implement because it would need to change tiles in
  the nametable
- Better looking smoke (and support for multiple particles at once)
- Translate assembly code from NESASM to ca65 to avoid dumb labels
